Flavor has an odd burn that hits on the first sip. After it fades it seems like a dirty vanilla aftertaste. Perhaps this is the absinthe? Regardless of that, I get a quite spiced tone on the tongue. Almost feel a little heat from it. I think that my inexperienced palate on these spices is contributing to my ignorance of what precisely they are. Overall a nice drinker indeed.",

Label pivoting around the image of a standing/hopping frog holding a jar of beer (amber-pumpkin on this version). Perfunctorily terribly designed label with assorted fonts and the standard awful array of blends and color effects with the added novelty of... A picture of the moon under the glow of the name? Side paragraphs offer a general description of the brew, and intent. Lacks any bottling or freshness date. Notes Alc. by Vol. (8.4%), IBUs (7.3), and OG (76). Served in a snifter. \t\tA - Medium amber to orange pumpkin color with a nice creamy head that fades quickly leaving a fair surface memory.\t\tS - Well balanced nose with a characteristic pumpkin sense, sweet and riding on a nice gamut of spices. Good balance, although a bit less and it would be short, hitting the right note with some risk.\t\tT - Follows nicely the smell with a good malt backbone woven with pumpkin and a rich balance of spices complementing the brew.\t\tM - Medium to medium-light body, medium prickly carbonation, finely tuned.\t\tD - Deceptively quaffable given the alcohol bill, which is rather well integrated. Nice pumpkin ale.\t\tNotes: Sure, this could do with an additional hefty note and still be quite notable as a pumpkin ale, but in this incarnation it feels very well rounded, so why touch it?",

Needed a strong SEPA brew to soften the shocking blow that comes with learning that one of my best friends from high school died today (he was killed by a car while riding his bike in his adopted hometown of Philly ~ a toast to Russ). \t\tThe goofy 'Abominable' cartoon made me smile on an otherwise somber day...\t\tA: Lovely and leathery, an alluring chestnut/garnet, barely translucent. No signs of yeasty bits nor other fatigue from the years in captivity. Starts with about a finger of fizzy but firm khaki cream. A slow droop, then a small break in the topping, then a crescent ring. Slick speckles of lace.\t\tS: Sweet and nutty, toffee and candied fruit - er, fruitcake. A 'buttered rum' quality, but little notable woody/oaky aroma.\t\tT: The requisite toffee, mellowed fruit form a dreamy, dessert-worthy concoction. A little butterscotch (or creme brulee?). Fruity apple pie, something a little brandy-like. Oak, though tame, still holds a fair vanilla bean and charred woodiness. Very well balanced.\t\tM: Velvet, pure velvet...sweetly coating. Modest carbonation and trace amounts of lip-smacking stickiness. Medium thickness. Easy on the tongue, as they say...\t\tD: Love the beer, hate the occasion for opening it. Definitely worth saving, as it's damn delicious and oh so drinkable. Wish I had another; cherish it while you can. That goes for beer and life, both.\t\tThanks to zrrbrrt/jyoungsbcp, aka Josh for sending way back when...",

It is simple, clear amber.\t\t\tUnfortunately, Harmon really dropped the ball on this fall seasonal. It is green tasting and oddly devoid of even the slightest hop aroma. The 68 IBUs of Glacier hops really dont shine, making this hard to reconcile as a single hop showcase beer. One Hop Wonder is not a completely disastrous ale, but the body is lifeless and the beer remains conceptually undeveloped. Nothing in the taste or aroma remotely resemble an IPA. It tastes like tired yeasts unable to pull their weight, and the finish is deathly. \t\t\tNot up to Harmon standards.",

        "description": "Pours a murky amber with a nice off-white head. There's enough yeast in this bottle to brew a batch without a starter. It's outta control. \t\tNose is quite spicy, with the cinnamon and nutmeg jumping out at you and little else escaping. It's rich and full in the mouth, fairly spicy with the spcies lasting long into the finish. As it warms, the soft, bready aspects rise up and the pumpkin flavor becomes predominant. The level of spice remains high, but now it's balanced just wonderfully with the malt and pumpkin. The finish is long, spicy and rounded out with that breadiness.\t\tSo drinkable that I went through three and only stopped because I didn't want to run out before Friday night.\t\tReally, really nice. I don't like pumpkin beers. I really like this beer, though, it'll be a regular in my fridge until it's season is gone. \t\t\tTop-noch effort from the area's quirkiest brewery.",

        "description": "Got this from a best friend that shipped it back from his vacation. \t\tThe appearance is an amber to brighter red. This is actually the color of a red ale. It pours a one finger head with a crisp carbonation. \t\tThe smell is of a sweet sweet alcohol and bitter hops. Also some honey and citrus. \t\tThe taste is good, but the alcohol presence is clear. It tastes more like a strong ale, something along the lines of a Arrogant Bastard. It is good, a real oily mouthfeel. Hop flavors abound, really nice, also a warm cinnamon flavor as well. \t\tThe drinkabilty is good. You can taste the alcohol once it warms up, but really nothing spectacular stands out. The nice aspect to the brew, as stated earlier, is the oil that coats the mouth when a taste is taken. Overall a good beer, nothing outstanding, but worth trying. \t\tJ",

        "description": "I had this one on tap at the Horse Brass in Portland, Oregon. It came in dark orange/golden color with a good sized frothy white head that left lacing on the glass all the way down. It smelled very hoppy and sweet/sour in a citrus way as well. The taste was great. Very hoppy and bitter with a kind of sweet citrus tone to it as well. Mouthfeel was good, this one has some bite and it left a dry/bitter aftertaste that made my mouth water for more. Overall this is a good beer, tastes great, goes down smooth, doesn't disappoint.",

Decent.\t\tS: I get some brown sugar, nutmeg, and pumpkin upfront with some sweet caramel malt in the middle and some, almost ketchup scent on the backend. Who doesn't like ketchup? Good.\t\tT: I get some heavy pumpkin flavor upfront with boozy nutmeg and piney flavors in the middle and some ginger and clove on the backend. Good.\t\tM: Medium body with a nice carbonation feel flirting with thick carbonation. Good.\t\tD: Goes down good despite the blend of flavors. Good.\t\tAll in all, this is a solid brew. Not amazing, but good. Good to try if you like Pumpkin ales. Otherwise, don't bother hunting down.",
